# CS50x-2021
> The course recognizes that interactions with classmates and others can facilitate mastery of the course’s material. *However, there remains a line between enlisting the help of another and submitting the work of another.* The course’s [policy](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/honesty/#policy) characterizes both sides of that line. Investing time and energy into solving the problem sets is the only way to eventual mastery.\
